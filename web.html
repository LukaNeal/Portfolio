    <div class="webdetails">This project started as purely me just seeing if I could do it for kicks. I mean, I had always
        loved the idea of taking some absurd invention from the comics or movies I loved and making it real,
        but I had never taken it this far. It started when I realized that I had a consistent source of compressed air: the canisters
        we use in our SodaStream water carbonating machine. I know it sounds stupid, but I just kind of built up from there.
        Using a custom adapter that I had to ship from Australia, some tubing, adapters, a regulator and a solenoid valve from all from Amazon, I wired 
        up the first version with a push button to quickly open and close the valve to let the air out in shots. After I had the basic concept
        built, I actually needed something to launch and wrap around things. As you can see in one of the videos off to the side, 
        I realized that I happened to have a pen tip that perfectly fit within the 1/4' steel barrel I had! After a little bit of
        soldering and some very crude melting my wire cable together that would trail behind the pen tip, I was ready to go.
        
        <br>I optimized the webshooter simply by making sure I had plenty of teflon tape and tight fittings, and ended up with a surprisingly fast-firing projectile
        that I could launch around bars and use to hoist myself up.
