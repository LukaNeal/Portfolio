    <div class="oldwebdetails">This website was created for a project at my old highschool, the
        High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, which I attended for Creative Writing. The website was meant
    to double as an artistic portfolio, and I worked on it for about two weeks before realizing I needed to learn a lot more about
website development. The pages are jumbled and don't fit displays other than the one I programmed them on, which was a huge mistake.
As wrong as this project went, it gave me the drive to make my code better. It increased my efficiency and my overall knowlegde
of both HTML and CSS. I like to think that all the issues this small website posed were just stepping stones in making
me a better programmer. Unlike the old website, this website is much better optimized for different display settings. I made sure 
to take what I knew from the previous website and reformat it to fit dimensions from around 1366X768 all the way to 1920X1080.</div>
