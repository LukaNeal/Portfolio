    <div class="oldwebdetails"> This one was pretty straightforward. I had been using Linux for a while through virtual machines, but had decided
        I really wanted a dedicated computer that I could use for hacking and other networking projects. There really is no downside to using a VM, but I had 
        also noticed that there was an old, beat up laptop that had been collecting dust on one of the shelves in the house, so I took it upon
        myself to fix it up and use it as my Linux machine. I started by downloading my distro onto a flashdrive that I could then mount onto the Mac,
        getting rid of the original operating system. The trackpad of the laptop also seemed to not register any input, and the battery could hold literally
        zero charge, two issues I soon learned were related. The li-ion battery had inflated because the laptop hadn't been used in so long and the gas was building
        up within it, and the way macs are formatted places the battery right under the trackpad, which answered the question of the input. After carefully
        dismantling and disposing the battery, I ordered a new one as well as a trackpad just to be safe. The laptop functions as a native linux machine while using
        the hardware of a 2012 MacBook Pro.
